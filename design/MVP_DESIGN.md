Taking a step back from the larger design goal.

## Big Principles

Reactivity is not designed to replace real conversations, email, or instant messaging. It is designed to encourage asynchronous communication inside and between teams.

Far too often, developers and management fall into the trap of "5 minute standup that becomes 60 minute design meeting." This can lead to:

* Decreased productivity
* Confusion
* Loss of information
* Low team morale concerning the usefulness of meetings

Reactivity's goal is to replace many of the quick status meetings, and help teams escape from that cycle. It has the following features:

* team-based status channels 
* Immediate data presentation - looking at a channel should allow you to grok your team's situation immediately (what people are doing, or are blocked by).


Scenario:

1. mochify has three team members (alexkuang, birryree, himekat) and a stream called 'mochify'.
2. At the top of the morning, it's status update time.
3. alexkuang opens the reactivity app and types in a status that goes to the mochify stream
